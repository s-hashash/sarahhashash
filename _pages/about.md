Hello! I’m a 1st year PhD student in the Institute for Computational & Mathematical Engineering (ICME) at Stanford University, as well as a NDSEG Fellow and NSF GRFP Awardee. I’m currently rotating with Prof. Madeleine Udell and Prof. Ramesh Johari from the MS&E Department.

## Bio

I grew up in Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, and obtained my Bachelor’s of Science from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in June 2024 with majors in computer science and economics. During my time at Caltech, I worked with Prof. Alvarez, Prof. Wierman, and Danny Ebanks. Outside of research, I enjoy hiking and playing tennis.

title: "[Evaluating Characteristics of CUDA Communication Primitives on High-Bandwidth Interconnect](https://sarahhashash.github.io/files/CUDAComm.pdf)"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'CommScope is a set of microbenchmarks designed to help system and application developers analyze and optimize memory transfer behavior across various data placement and exchange scenarios in heterogeneous systems. It evaluates CUDA data transfer primitives on architectures like POWER and x86 with interconnects such as PCIe and NVLink, providing insights into system design and application optimization.'

excerpt: 'This study investigates the role of collective identity versus individual interest in driving protest participation, using data from Twitter users involved in the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. The findings suggest that individual interest, rather than collective identity, is a stronger predictor of protest participation, challenging prior research that conflated these factors and overestimated the role of collective identity.'

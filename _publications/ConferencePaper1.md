title: "Enabling Computational Democratization: A Proof-of-Stake Bounty
System for User-Proposed Problems and Solutions."
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'A novel framework replaces energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining with a modified Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism that rewards miners for solving user-proposed computational problems. This approach incentivizes PoW miners to transition by allowing them to leverage their existing hardware investments.'
